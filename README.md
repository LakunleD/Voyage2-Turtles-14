## Next Tab Extension - Work in progress...

A "new tab" Extension for Google Chrome that shows current weather forcast, browser history, and system information right in your browser when you open a new tab.

Inspiration for the app is taken from three different extensions ("Currently", "Cardboard", and "Be Limitless").

## To test it out (Deploying to Google Chrome)

- Clone  the repository  using `git clone`, or Download directly to your local machine.
- Switch to the `develop` branch using `git checkout develop`
- run `npm install` to get all the project dependencies
- run `npm run build` or if you are using yarn, do `yarn build`. This creates a `build` folder inside the project
- Got to your chrome browser, and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar
- Then click the `Load unpacked extension` button and select the `build` folder inside the project folder
- Open a new tab in your browser and you should see a custom new tab page.
